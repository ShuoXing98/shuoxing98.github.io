    I am a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://taco-group.github.io/" target="_blank">TACO Lab</a> in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>, supervised by 
    Prof. <a href="https://vztu.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhengzhong Tu</a>.  
    I received my Master of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://en.nankai.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nankai University</a> under the supervision of Prof. 
    <a href="http://en.math.nankai.edu.cn/2015/1112/c4059a32170/page.htm" target="_blank">Peixin Ye</a> in 2023.  
    Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science degree at <a href="http://www.nxu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Ningxia University</a> in 2020. From 2022 to 2023, I was a research intern at the 
    Statistics and Machine Learning Research Group, the <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>. I am fortunate to have been working closely with 
    Dr. <a href="https://shizhediao.github.io/" target="_blank">Shizhe Diao</a>(NVIDIA Research).
