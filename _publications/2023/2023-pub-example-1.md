  We propose and analyze sample-efficient algorithms for monotone submodular maximization with cardinality and matroid constraints, as well as unconstrained non-monotone submodular maximization. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical evaluation on real instances, demonstrating the superior sample efficiency of our proposed algorithm relative to alternative approaches.
