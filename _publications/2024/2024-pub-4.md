  Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasing prevalent in the modern world, and as a result there has been significant recent study into algorithmic fairness in order to minimize the possibility of unintentional bias or discrimination in these algorithms. Submodular optimization problems also arise in many machine learning applications, including those such as data summarization and clustering where fairness is an important concern. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Fair Submodular Cover Problem (FSC). Given a ground set $U$, a monotone submodular function $f:2^U\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and a threshold $\tau$, the goal of FSC is to find a balanced subset of $U$ with minimum cardinality such that $f(S)\ge\tau$. We first introduce discrete algorithms for FSC that achieve a bicriteria approximation ratio of $(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}, 1-O(\varepsilon))$. We then present a continuous algorithm that achieves a $(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}, 1-O(\varepsilon))$-bicriteria approximation ratio, which matches the best approximation guarantee of submodular cover without a fairness constraint. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with a number of empirical evaluations that demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms on instances of maximum coverage.
