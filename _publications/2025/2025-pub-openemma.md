abstract: >-
  Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in inference computing, we propose OpenEMMA, an open-source end-to-end framework based on MLLMs. By incorporating the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process, OpenEMMA achieves significant improvements compared to the baseline when leveraging a diverse range of MLLMs. Furthermore, OpenEMMA demonstrates effectiveness, generalizability, and robustness across a variety of challenging driving scenarios, offering a more efficient and effective approach to autonomous driving.
