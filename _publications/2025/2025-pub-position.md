  In this paper we provide an outlook on this field summarizing existing methods and exploring their limitations. In addition we further discuss the applicability of emerging approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Mamba for applications in autonomous driving. Finally we highlight open questions and offer insights into promising directions for future research. This paper is part of a living document that will be updated based on the LLVM-AD workshop series to reflect the latest developments in the field.
